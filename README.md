# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Iris Flower Classification** project! This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end approach to classifying iris flowers into three species—**Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**—based on their measurements using machine learning.

This work is proudly completed as part of the **AICTE Oasis Infobyte Internship 2025**.
